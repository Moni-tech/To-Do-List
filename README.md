# 🚀 Simple To-Do List

A simple, interactive To-Do List web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to manage their daily tasks with features like adding, editing, completing, and deleting todos. Tasks are persisted locally using the browser's localStorage, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was made to practice core web development skills:

- 💻 Building interactive pages using JavaScript.
- 🎨 Styling layouts with CSS.
- 💾 Managing browser data using localStorage.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ **Add New Todos**: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" or press Enter to add it to the list.
- ✅ **Mark as Completed**: Check the checkbox next to a todo to mark it as completed (with a line-through effect).
- ✏️ **Edit Todos**: Double-click on the text of a todo to edit it in a prompt dialog.
- 🗑️ **Delete Todos**: Click the "Delete" button next to a todo to remove it from the list.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Todos are automatically saved to localStorage and reloaded when the page is refreshed.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: The app is styled with a modern gradient background and is responsive for mobile devices.
- ✨ **Smooth Animations**: Includes fade-in animations for new todos and hover effects.
